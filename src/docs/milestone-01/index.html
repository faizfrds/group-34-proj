            Our project aims to develop a comprehensive productivity application
            tailored specifically for students from a spectrum of educational
            backgrounds. In today's fast-paced and digital academic environment,
            students often find themselves burdened by juggling a multitude of
            tasks, deadlines, and commitments that they simply cannot manage.
            The various learning management systems used complicate this problem
            even more as students do not have a centralized system to head to.
            Our application intends to alleviate this problem by providing a
            centralized platform for organizing and managing their academic
            responsibilities. By offering handy task management features, like
            customizable to-do lists that can be organized by the due dates, to
            viewing assignments by class, our app enables students to
            efficiently manage their assignments, ensuring that their time is
            spent more on their academics rather than dwelling in their stress
            and anxiety on managing their time. Not only does this increase
            student motivation, but it also boosts their motivation which aids
            in their overall mental well-being. Overall, our ultimate goal is to
            foster a healthy productivity culture within education, empowering
            them to achieve academic success while also maintaining a thriving
            state of mind.

          <p><strong>Key Features of Academix:</strong></p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Student Dashboard:</strong> The gateway to academic
            organization, the homepage displays all current classes a student is
            enrolled in. It allows users to easily add or remove classes, with
            an option to archive past classes, preserving uploaded materials
            while decluttering the main view. To add a class, the user simply
            clicks on the plus icon and enters a class name. Classes can also be
            personalized with unique icons the user uploads, making the
            experience more engaging and personalized. From here, students can
            navigate to the calendar to visualize their schedule or dive into
            specific class pages.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Individual Class Pages:</strong> The core of the class is
            contained here, where users will find their
            <strong>To-Do List</strong>, <strong>Review Section</strong>, and
            <strong>Materials Section</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>-> To-Do List:</strong> Displays upcoming assignments and
              quizzes/exams, keeping students on track with their deadlines.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>-> Review Section:</strong> Here students can enter the
              names of topics from a lecture or the lecture number itself and
              click an option based on their understanding (beginner, almost
              there, master). This allows students to keep track of everything
              covered in class and what material they need to focus on more,
              aiding in efficient exam preparation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>-> Materials Section:</strong> Here the user can upload
              files they want to store for the class, this could be anything the
              student deems important to the class. Lecture notes, links to
              study videos, anything. The result is a repository for important
              class materials, ensuring everything vital is just a click away.
            </li>
            <br />
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Assignment and Material Uploads:</strong> Central to keeping
            academic tasks in check, this feature enables students to add
            assignments along with their due dates directly from the homepage or
            within individual class pages. Assignments are tagged to specific
            classes through a dropdown menu, streamlining organization. An
            important note, if a student adds an assignment while on a class
            page, the assignment is automatically tagged to that class.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Calendar View:</strong> The big picture, this dynamic
            calendar updates in real-time, displaying upcoming, current, and
            past assignments. It allows for class-specific filtering, helping
            students focus on one course at a time. After a student completes an
            assignment, they can check it off and are celebrated with confetti
            and a congratulatory message, fostering a positive feedback loop,
            and keeping them motivated.

        <section class="mb-10" id="data-requirements">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-700">Data Requirements</h2>
          <p>
            Under the id “data-requirements,” structure this section to include
            an introduction, four main paragraphs detailing the top types of
            data your application will handle, and a conclusion, making up 300
            words in total. Title the section with an tag. Focus on high-level
            data needs rather than specific database designs or records. Here is
            an example of one data requirement: One of the foundational data
            requirements for our web application, EcoConnect, is the
            comprehensive database of local recycling centers. This database is
            critical as it serves as the backbone of our interactive map
            feature, enabling users to easily locate recycling facilities in
            their vicinity. For each center, the database will store essential
            information such as the physical address, GPS coordinates for
            precise mapping, operating hours, and a detailed list of accepted
            recyclable materials. This categorization of materials is
            particularly important as it guides users in sorting their
            recyclables correctly, ensuring that items are processed efficiently
            and effectively. Additionally, the database will include contact
            information for each facility, allowing users to inquire directly
            about specific recycling guidelines or services. By aggregating this
            data, EcoConnect aims to demystify the recycling process for its
            users, providing a user-friendly platform that encourages and
            facilitates active participation in local recycling efforts. The
            creation and maintenance of this database represent a significant
            step towards our goal of enhancing sustainability practices within
            the community, showcasing the application's commitment to solving
            real-world environmental challenges through accessible and
            actionable information.

          <p>
            In today’s world, students frequently struggle to manage numerous
            tasks from different classes effectively. This challenge to keep
            track of deadlines and organize assignments can lead to missed
            assignments, which results in stress and decreased academic
            performance. Traditional methods of organizing tasks, such as paper
            planners or basic digital calendars (iCalendar, Google Calendar,
            etc), often lack the specificity and customization needed to deal
            with the complexities of academic schedules. In addition, while some
            platforms are equipped to deal with these complexities (like
            Notion), they are hard to understand and set up, leading to
            frustrated users who feel like they have no choice but to give up on
            being organized. <br /><br />
            To address this issue, we introduce a user-friendly website that
            makes homework management easy. We provide students with a
            centralized platform to input, organize, and monitor their
            assignments effectively. Our website allows students to input their
            homework assignments and categorize them based on class and due
            date. With a user-friendly interface resembling popular learning
            management systems such as Canvas, students can easily navigate
            between classes and access detailed information about each
            assignment. Additionally, the calendar view provides a visual
            representation of upcoming deadlines, allowing students to
            prioritize tasks effectively. In short, this is a website for
            students made by students. <br /><br />
            Our website addresses a tangible real-world issue many individuals
            face in academic settings by providing students with a centralized
            platform to manage their homework assignments. Through intuitive
            design and customizable features, we aim to empower students to take
            control of their educational responsibilities and alleviate the
            stress associated with homework management.

          <p>
            This project culminates our university education and personal
            growth, reflecting the integrative experience requirements outlined
            in our coursework. Over the past 2-3 years at UMass, we have taken
            various courses, some related to computer/data science and some
            related to other subjects such as history, math, English, etc. These
            classes have taught us the skills necessary to develop this project
            and give us the idea. Courses such as COMPSCI 220 and COMPSCI 326
            have prepared us thoroughly for creating this website by giving us
            the tools to make this a user-friendly interface and make it a
            functional application. Moreover, by working together, we could use
            our diverse perspectives to incorporate different approaches to this
            project, thus ensuring the best application. <br /><br />
            Our personal experiences have been a driving force in the formation
            and shaping of this project. As students, we have grappled with the
            challenge of managing multiple assignments across different classes,
            necessitating an efficient homework management system. This project
            is a testament to our commitment to using technology to address
            real-world issues while drawing on the multidisciplinary knowledge
            and abilities we have acquired over our academic careers. By
            integrating various facets of our academic and personal experiences,
            our application not only exemplifies the integrative thinking
            fostered by the IE requirement but also provides a structured
            context for reflection, learning, and application of skills to
            real-world problems.
