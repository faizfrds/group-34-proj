          <p>
            Our project aims to develop a comprehensive productivity application
            tailored specifically for students from a spectrum of educational
            backgrounds. In today's fast-paced and digital academic environment,
            students often find themselves burdened by juggling a multitude of
            tasks, deadlines, and commitments that they simply cannot manage.
            The various learning management systems used complicate this problem
            even more as students do not have a centralized system to head to.
            Our application intends to alleviate this problem by providing a
            centralized platform for organizing and managing their academic
            responsibilities. By offering handy task management features, like
            customizable to-do lists that can be organized by the due dates, to
            viewing assignments by class, our app enables students to
            efficiently manage their assignments, ensuring that their time is
            spent more on their academics rather than dwelling in their stress
            and anxiety on managing their time. Not only does this increase
            student motivation, but it also boosts their motivation which aids
            in their overall mental well-being. Overall, our ultimate goal is to
            foster a healthy productivity culture within education, empowering
            them to achieve academic success while also maintaining a thriving
            state of mind.

          <p><strong>Key Features of Academix:</strong></p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Student Dashboard:</strong> The gateway to academic
            organization, the homepage displays all current classes a student is
            enrolled in. It allows users to easily add or remove classes, with
            an option to archive past classes, preserving uploaded materials
            while decluttering the main view. To add a class, the user simply
            clicks on the plus icon and enters a class name. Classes can also be
            personalized with unique icons the user uploads, making the
            experience more engaging and personalized. From here, students can
            navigate to the calendar to visualize their schedule or dive into
            specific class pages.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Individual Class Pages:</strong> The core of the class is
            contained here, where users will find their
            <strong>To-Do List</strong>, <strong>Review Section</strong>, and
            <strong>Materials Section</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>-> To-Do List:</strong> Displays upcoming assignments and
              quizzes/exams, keeping students on track with their deadlines.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>-> Review Section:</strong> Here students can enter the
              names of topics from a lecture or the lecture number itself and
              click an option based on their understanding (beginner, almost
              there, master). This allows students to keep track of everything
              covered in class and what material they need to focus on more,
              aiding in efficient exam preparation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>-> Materials Section:</strong> Here the user can upload
              files they want to store for the class, this could be anything the
              student deems important to the class. Lecture notes, links to
              study videos, anything. The result is a repository for important
              class materials, ensuring everything vital is just a click away.
            </li>
            <br />
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Assignment and Material Uploads:</strong> Central to keeping
            academic tasks in check, this feature enables students to add
            assignments along with their due dates directly from the homepage or
            within individual class pages. Assignments are tagged to specific
            classes through a dropdown menu, streamlining organization. An
            important note, if a student adds an assignment while on a class
            page, the assignment is automatically tagged to that class.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Calendar View:</strong> The big picture, this dynamic
            calendar updates in real-time, displaying upcoming, current, and
            past assignments. It allows for class-specific filtering, helping
            students focus on one course at a time. After a student completes an
            assignment, they can check it off and are celebrated with confetti
            and a congratulatory message, fostering a positive feedback loop,
            and keeping them motivated.
          </p>

        <section class="mb-10" id="data-requirements">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-700">Data Requirements</h2>
          <p>The foundation of an effective productivity application for students lies in its capability to manage and present the most relevant data for a student on a day to day basis effectively. For our project, we envisioned a comprehensive application that targets the varying needs of student users from different academic backgrounds. Addressing the high-level data needs of our application is essential in crafting a platform of this nature.
          </p><br>
          
          <p>To create a tab where the user can view and add/remove classes we need a comprehensive database of departments, courses, and other academic entities. For each course, we will store data elements such as the course name, code, instructor details, class schedules, and syllabi.This data will be used to create a schedule view that shows the dates and times of lectures and labs that a student has throughout the week.  Students will be able to look up and add classes to their schedule based on any of the listed data elements. Aligning with the student's academic structure facilitates a more intuitive navigation and organization within the application.
          </p><br>

          <p>A task and assignment management system that necessitates tracking various elements, like assignment descriptions, due dates, priority levels, and completion statuses will be central to our application. Databases containing these elements for each class will help fuel this system. Academicx will support customization and categorization based on subjects or courses, enabling students to view and prioritize their workloads accurately. The data captured here will be displayed as the heart of the application, where students can manage their tasks through an interface that corresponds with their daily academic life. As this database will be used for both the assignment menu and calendar view, students will be able to add assignments from various classes and quickly see what areas of the month ahead of them looks like in terms of academic rigor. This will enable the student to be able to plan ahead more efficiently.
          </p><br>

          <p>Acedemix will incorporate data reflecting user preferences, such as notification settings, theme choices, and custom tags for tasks. By personalizing user interaction with the application, an environment will be created that reflects each students personal academic needs
          </p><br>

          <p>Our application will handle integration and interoperability data to synchronize with other systems. This includes API keys, authentication tokens, and metadata that enable seamless connections with external learning management systems, calendars, and educational tools. The handling of student data is performed with privacy and security at the forefront to allow for a centralized yet secure compilation of the student's academic operations across various platforms.
          </p><br>

          <p>In summary, handling these types of data: academic structure information, task and assignment management, personalization and user preferences, and integration and interoperability, will ensure our productivity application addresses the complex needs of student users.  Through this application, students will be empowered to excel academically, manage their time efficiently, and maintain a balanced state of mental well-being.

          <p>The dashboard houses all of the student's classes and from here they can add assignments and access their calendar through the navbar. The dashboard was designed to be simple and intuitive. Here the student has added three classes and they can edit the classes by clicking on the black dots in the top right corner of each class. There they can edit the image of the class or remove it, and to add classes the user simply clicks on the add symbol.

            </div>
          <p>The Individual class page was designed to give the user information that would be most helpful to them now. This was accomplished by showing the current week and what assignments/quizzes/exams they have due. At the bottom, we also display the material the user hasn't mastered yet. This allows the user to take one look and immediately know what they must study to excel in the class. From this class page, the user can also access, through the navbar,  the study materials that they’ve uploaded, all the information to review, add assignments, and see a full calendar view for the class.

Use real-world examples as inspiration for this narrative, detailing the problem your project aims to resolve. Here are some examples to give you an idea of what we are looking for:</p> -->
          <p>
            In today’s world, students frequently struggle to manage numerous
            tasks from different classes effectively. This challenge to keep
            track of deadlines and organize assignments can lead to missed
            assignments, which results in stress and decreased academic
            performance. Traditional methods of organizing tasks, such as paper
            planners or basic digital calendars (iCalendar, Google Calendar,
            etc), often lack the specificity and customization needed to deal
            with the complexities of academic schedules. In addition, while some
            platforms are equipped to deal with these complexities (like
            Notion), they are hard to understand and set up, leading to
            frustrated users who feel like they have no choice but to give up on
            being organized. <br /><br />
            To address this issue, we introduce a user-friendly website that
            makes homework management easy. We provide students with a
            centralized platform to input, organize, and monitor their
            assignments effectively. Our website allows students to input their
            homework assignments and categorize them based on class and due
            date. With a user-friendly interface resembling popular learning
            management systems such as Canvas, students can easily navigate
            between classes and access detailed information about each
            assignment. Additionally, the calendar view provides a visual
            representation of upcoming deadlines, allowing students to
            prioritize tasks effectively. In short, this is a website for
            students made by students. <br /><br />
            Our website addresses a tangible real-world issue many individuals
            face in academic settings by providing students with a centralized
            platform to manage their homework assignments. Through intuitive
            design and customizable features, we aim to empower students to take
            control of their educational responsibilities and alleviate the
            stress associated with homework management.

          <p>
            This project culminates our university education and personal
            growth, reflecting the integrative experience requirements outlined
            in our coursework. Over the past 2-3 years at UMass, we have taken
            various courses, some related to computer/data science and some
            related to other subjects such as history, math, English, etc. These
            classes have taught us the skills necessary to develop this project
            and give us the idea. Courses such as COMPSCI 220 and COMPSCI 326
            have prepared us thoroughly for creating this website by giving us
            the tools to make this a user-friendly interface and make it a
            functional application. Moreover, by working together, we could use
            our diverse perspectives to incorporate different approaches to this
            project, thus ensuring the best application. <br /><br />
            Our personal experiences have been a driving force in the formation
            and shaping of this project. As students, we have grappled with the
            challenge of managing multiple assignments across different classes,
            necessitating an efficient homework management system. This project
            is a testament to our commitment to using technology to address
            real-world issues while drawing on the multidisciplinary knowledge
            and abilities we have acquired over our academic careers. By
            integrating various facets of our academic and personal experiences,
            our application not only exemplifies the integrative thinking
            fostered by the IE requirement but also provides a structured
            context for reflection, learning, and application of skills to
            real-world problems.
