          <p>2. Identified by the id “application-parts,” describe at least three **critical components** of your application in separate paragraphs under this section, totaling 200-300 words. Title this section with an **`h2`** tag and ensure each application part discussed represents a primary functionality of your web application. Here is an example of a one component of an application:
 The Interactive Map feature stands as a pivotal component of EcoConnect, designed to seamlessly guide users through the discovery of local recycling centers. By leveraging real-time GPS data, the map offers an intuitive, user-friendly interface that allows individuals to easily find facilities based on their current location or search criteria. This feature not only simplifies the process of locating recycling options but also encourages user engagement by integrating interactive elements such as filters for different types of recyclables and detailed information pop-ups for each center. The Interactive Map exemplifies how EcoConnect blends technology with environmental stewardship, making it a cornerstone of the application's mission to promote recycling and sustainability within the community.

        <section class="mb-10" id="data-requirements">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Data Requirements</h2>
          <p>Under the id “data-requirements,” structure this section to include an introduction, four main paragraphs detailing the top types of data your application will handle, and a conclusion, making up 300 words in total. Title the section with an tag. Focus on high-level data needs rather than specific database designs or records. Here is an example of one data requirement: One of the foundational data requirements for our web application, EcoConnect, is the comprehensive database of local recycling centers. This database is critical as it serves as the backbone of our interactive map feature, enabling users to easily locate recycling facilities in their vicinity. For each center, the database will store essential information such as the physical address, GPS coordinates for precise mapping, operating hours, and a detailed list of accepted recyclable materials. This categorization of materials is particularly important as it guides users in sorting their recyclables correctly, ensuring that items are processed efficiently and effectively. Additionally, the database will include contact information for each facility, allowing users to inquire directly about specific recycling guidelines or services. By aggregating this data, EcoConnect aims to demystify the recycling process for its users, providing a user-friendly platform that encourages and facilitates active participation in local recycling efforts. The creation and maintenance of this database represent a significant step towards our goal of enhancing sustainability practices within the community, showcasing the application's commitment to solving real-world environmental challenges through accessible and actionable information.</p>

          <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Real-World Connection</h2>
          <!-- <p>With the id “real-world,” this section, spanning 200 words, should elucidate how your application addresses a tangible real-world issue, supported by an introduction and conclusion. Use real-world examples as inspiration for this narrative, detailing the problem your project aims to resolve. Here are some examples to give you an idea of what we are looking for:</p> -->
          <p>
            In today’s world, students frequently struggle to manage numerous tasks from different classes effectively. This challenge to keep track of deadlines and organize assignments can lead to missed assignments, which results in stress and decreased academic performance. Traditional methods of organizing tasks, such as paper planners or basic digital calendars (iCalendar, Google Calendar, etc), often lack the specificity and customization needed to deal with the complexities of academic schedules. In addition, while some platforms are equipped to deal with these complexities (like Notion), they are hard to understand and set up, leading to frustrated users who feel like they have no choice but to give up on being organized. <br><br>
            To address this issue, we introduce a user-friendly website that makes homework management easy. We provide students with a centralized platform to input, organize, and monitor their assignments effectively. Our website allows students to input their homework assignments and categorize them based on class and due date. With a user-friendly interface resembling popular learning management systems such as Canvas, students can easily navigate between classes and access detailed information about each assignment. Additionally, the calendar view provides a visual representation of upcoming deadlines, allowing students to prioritize tasks effectively. In short, this is a website for students made by students. <br><br>
            Our website addresses a tangible real-world issue many individuals face in academic settings by providing students with a centralized platform to manage their homework assignments. Through intuitive design and customizable features, we aim to empower students to take control of their educational responsibilities and alleviate the stress associated with homework management.

          <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Integrative Experience</h2>
          <!-- <p>6. Marked by the id “integrative-experience,” in 200 words, detail how this project ties into the [integrative experience](https://www.umass.edu/gened/objectives-designations/curricular-designations/integrative-experience) requirements of your coursework and personal experiences. Discuss how your project is a culmination of your university education and personal growth, touching upon specific courses, semesters, and life experiences that contribute to the development of this project.</p> -->
          <p>
            This project culminates our university education and personal growth, reflecting the integrative experience requirements outlined in our coursework. Over the past 2-3 years at UMass, we have taken various courses, some related to computer/data science and some related to other subjects such as history, math, English, etc. These classes have taught us the skills necessary to develop this project and give us the idea. Courses such as COMPSCI 220 and COMPSCI 326 have prepared us thoroughly for creating this website by giving us the tools to make this a user-friendly interface and make it a functional application. Moreover, by working together, we could use our diverse perspectives to incorporate different approaches to this project, thus ensuring the best application. <br><br>
            Our personal experiences have been a driving force in the formation and shaping of this project. As students, we have grappled with the challenge of managing multiple assignments across different classes, necessitating an efficient homework management system. This project is a testament to our commitment to using technology to address real-world issues while drawing on the multidisciplinary knowledge and abilities we have acquired over our academic careers. By integrating various facets of our academic and personal experiences, our application not only exemplifies the integrative thinking fostered by the IE requirement but also provides a structured context for reflection, learning, and application of skills to real-world problems.
